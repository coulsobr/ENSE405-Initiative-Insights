## Project Idea
Develop an online tool that makes it simple for non-profit organizations to understand the roles their programs/initiatives play within SDG's and help them track/utilize them in a meaningful way.

## Project Background/Business Opportunity
I've been working closely with the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation and the concept of SDGs throughout the summer. During the UN SDG Cross-Sector Event that happened in June, Victor Roman Morrow presented on how charities/other organizations sometimes have problems knowing where to start integrating/recognizing the SDGs within their initiatives and how to measure the results. A lot of the time they want to, they just don't know how or don't have the capacity to sit down and come up with some ideas/solutions.

With the notion that charity organizations are usually stretched thin regarding resources (time, money, man power), they need something that is informative, yet doesn't take a lot of resources to obtain the required information. Surveys that take in information like organization missions, the root of their initiatives, and the nature of the communities they are targeting can then present results explaining which goals they are working towards. This would be a fantastic way to help them get started, it won't take a lot of their time, won't add any additional costs, and can get the creative ball rolling.

I would like to create a website that will ask the user questions to help them identify which goals their specific programs/initiatives are targeting. This website would also assist them by providing examples of small ways they can incorporate the new found SDG alignments into their initiatives. It can also provide resources on where they can learn more, and see examples of how other non-profits/organizations have incorporated similar SDG goals into their initiatives.
